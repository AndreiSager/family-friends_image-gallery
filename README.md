# Family-Friends Image Gallery

I just wanted a place to dump the pictures on my phone. So I created a gallery website starting with a Next.js template and added the features that I needed.

This was a fun project because my family who saw me working on this and decided to contribute fun and wacky pictures to the album.

I will be adding more pictures in the future everytime a new event occurs.
